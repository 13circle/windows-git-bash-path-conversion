# windows-git-bash-path-converter

## Motivation
Made this because it was so mad to convert path between Windows and Git Bash

## How to use
* Windows file path to Git Bash file path
```
wingbpath.exe [-tgb|--to-git-bash] path
```
* Git Bash file path to Windows file path
```
wingbpath.exe [-tw|--to-windows] path
```
